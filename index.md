My name is Ben Wallace and I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/). I started working on machine learning during my participation in the [Insight Fellows](https://insightfellows.com/) AI program, where I developed [ClearText](cleartext). You can find some of my earlier projects [here](code).

My background is in math: I was a postdoc at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/) and completed my PhD at [UBC](http://www.math.ubc.ca/). You can find my publications and theses [here](pubs) and slides from some of my talks [here]({% link talks.md %}).
