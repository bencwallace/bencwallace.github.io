**Hi, I'm Ben Wallace!**

I'm a developer at [FLXFlight](https://www.flxflight.com/) in Vienna. These days, I'm really interested in scientific applications of computing, especially machine learning and data science, probabilistic programming, and computational statistics. I'm particularly interested in applications to these areas of tools and insights from more traditional areas of computing, such as functional programming, parallel programming, and concurrency.

My background is in mathematics, specifically probability theory. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), under [Laszlo Erd√∂s](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/math-comp-sciences/erdoes-group/) and completed my PhD at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) under [Gordon Slade](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/). My research involved studying models from statistical physics.
