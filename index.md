My name is Ben Wallace and I'm an AI Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/) with a background in mathematical research.
I want to bring innovations in machine learning to domains where they can be effectively employed and I believe that good design is crucial in building robust and reproducible AI systems.

While at Insight I developed [ClearText](cleartext), a project to help English language learners improve their reading comprehension skills through the use of text simplification technology. You can also find some of my earlier projects [here](code).

My academic research focused on probability theory. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria after completing my PhD in mathematics at the University of British Columbia. You can find my publications and theses [here](pubs) and slides from some of my talks [here]({% link talks.md %}).

Some of my early steps towards machine learning and software engineering involved online courses. [Here](moocs) are some courses I'd recommend. I also recently started a [blog]({% link blog.md %}) to keep track of and share some of the things I've learned.
