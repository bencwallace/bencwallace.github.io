My name is Ben Wallace. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/). Before that, I did research in math (probability / statistical physics) at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/) and [UBC](http://www.math.ubc.ca/). Below are the results of some of my personal and professional projects.

## repos

**[Probly](https://github.com/bencwallace/probly)**  
A simple pure Python library for working with random variables.

**[ClearText](https://github.com/bencwallace/cleartext)**  
A smart reading assistant for English language learners. Completed during my time as an [Insight Fellow](https://insightfellows.com/).

**[doc2date](https://github.com/bencwallace/doc2date)**  
A case study in document regression.

**[slox](https://github.com/bencwallace/slox)**  
A Scala port of the jlox tree-walk interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

**[Polymers.jl](https://github.com/bencwallace/Polymers.jl)**  
A Julia implementation of the pivot algorithm for simulating linear polymer chains.
