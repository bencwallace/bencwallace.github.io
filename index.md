**Hi, I'm Ben Wallace!**

I'm really interested in mathematics, statistics, and computing. These interests come together especially well in data science and machine learning. My latest project, [doc2date]({% link doc2date.md %}), combines classical regression methods with natural language processing. Some of my other projects can be found [here]({% link code.md %}).

My background is in mathematics, specifically probability theory. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria, under [Laszlo Erd√∂s](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/math-comp-sciences/erdoes-group/) and wrote my thesis at the University of British Columbia under [Gordon Slade](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/). My research involved studying models from statistical physics. You can find my papers [here]({% link pubs.md %}) and slides from some of my talks [here]({% link talks.md %}).

I try to learn new things when I can. One way to do this is through online courses. For some online courses I'd recommend, click [here]({% link moocs.md %}). I also recently started a [blog]({% link blog.md %}) to keep track of and share some of the things I'm learning.
