My name is Ben Wallace and I'm an AI Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/) with a background in mathematical research.
I want to bring innovations in machine learning  to domains where they can be effectively employed and I believe that good design is crucial in building robust and reproducible AI systems.

While at Insight, I've been working on [ClearText](cleartext) a project to help English language learners advance their reading comprehension skills through the use of text simplification technology. You can also find some of my earlier projects [here](code).

My academic research work focused on probability theory. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria and completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia. You can find my publications and theses [here](pubs) and slides from some of my talks [here]({% link talks.md %}).

My very earliest steps towards working on AI involved taking online courses. For some courses I'd recommend, see [here](moocs). I also recently started a [blog]({% link blog.md %}) to keep track of and share some of the things I've been learning.
