**Hi, I'm Ben Wallace!**

These days, I'm really interested in scientific applications of computing, especially data science and machine learning. My latest project, [doc2date]({% link doc2date.md %}), combines classical regression methods with natural language processing. Some of my other projects can be found [on this site]({% link code.md %}).

My background is in mathematics, specifically probability theory. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria, under [Laszlo Erd√∂s](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/math-comp-sciences/erdoes-group/) and wrote my thesis at the University of British Columbia under [Gordon Slade](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/). My research involved studying models from statistical physics and you can find my papers [here]({% link pubs.md %}).
