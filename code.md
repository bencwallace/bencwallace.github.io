Here are some projects I've worked on in my spare time.

## [Probly](https://github.com/bencwallace/probly)

A Python framework for working with random variables.

## [Polymers.jl](https://github.com/bencwallace/Polymers.jl)

A Julia implementation of the pivot algorithm: a Markov chain Monte carlo (MCMC) sampler for the self-avoiding walk (SAW) model of a linear polymer chain.

## [slox](https://github.com/bencwallace/slox)

A Scala port of jlox, the Java implementation of a tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, from Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom.

## [ottiaq](https://github.com/bencwallace/ottiaq)

A simple application of web scraping for testing statistical uniformity of randomized search results.

## [colortab](https://github.com/bencwallace/colortab)

A Chrome extension that changes the new tab page to a blank page with a background color of your choice.

## [thiscv](https://github.com/bencwallace/thiscv)

A CV template written in Handlebars.js.

## [saw](https://github.com/bencwallace/saw)

An introduction to Markov chains and MCMC (including the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm), the self-avoiding walk (weak and strict), and the pivot algorithm.

## [toh](https://github.com/bencwallace/toh)

An implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for the nand2tetris Hack platform.
