Here are some projects I've worked on in my spare time.
For more, see my [github account](https://github.com/bencwallace/).

## [doc2date](https://github.com/bencwallace/doc2date)

An analysis of document dating using a variety of text representations and statistical models.
A case study in document regression.

## [Probly](https://github.com/bencwallace/probly)

A Python framework for working with random variables.

## [Polymers.jl](https://github.com/bencwallace/Polymers.jl)

A Julia implementation of the pivot algorithm: a Markov chain Monte carlo (MCMC) sampler for the self-avoiding walk (SAW) model of a linear polymer chain. I used Plotly to visualize the results of these simulations with interactive plots like the one below.

## [slox](https://github.com/bencwallace/slox)

A Scala port of jlox, the Java implementation of a tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, from Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom.

## [ottiaq](https://github.com/bencwallace/ottiaq)

A simple application of web scraping for testing statistical uniformity of randomized search results.

## [saw](https://github.com/bencwallace/saw)

A demontration of the pivot and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms.
