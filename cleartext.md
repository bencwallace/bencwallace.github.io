## ClearText

The smart reading assistant for English language learners

### Installation

ClearText is currently pending review for inclusion in the Chrome Web Store.
In the meantime, ClearText can be installed as an *unpacked extension* by following these instructions.

1. Download the ClearText extension, which consists of all the files in the [chrome subdirectory](https://github.com/bencwallace/cleartext/tree/master/chrome)
   of the ClearText Github repository. All files should be saved in the same directory. This can be done manually or by cloning the entire repository using git as follows:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bencwallace/cleartext
   ```
2. Open up Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. In the upper-right hand corner of the page, toggle on *Developer mode*, if it is not already active.
4. Near the upper-left hand corner of the page, click on *Load unpacked*.
5. Navigate to and select the directory where you saved the ClearText extension files and click *Open*.
6. The ClearText extension should now be visible in the *Extensions* page. If it is not already activate, toggle it on.
7. The ClearText extension icon should now be visible in the extension toolbar.

### Usage

1. Navigate to a page where you would like to simplify some text.
2. Select some text. Note that ClearText is optimized to work on single sentence selections.
3. Click on the ClearText extension icon in the Chrome extensions toolbar at the top-right hand side of your browser window.
