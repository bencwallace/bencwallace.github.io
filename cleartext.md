## ClearText

The smart reading assistant for English language learners.

## What it is

ClearText is a Google Chrome extension that makes it easy to *simplify* English language text found on any web page.
Just select a sentence you want to simplify and click on the ClearText extension icon to display the simplified text.

### Installation

ClearText is currently pending review for inclusion in the Chrome Web Store.
In the meantime, ClearText can be installed as an *unpacked extension* by following these instructions.

1. [Download][] and extract the ClearText extension.
2. Open up Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. In the upper-right hand corner of the page, toggle on *Developer mode*, if it is not already active.
4. Near the upper-left hand corner of the page, click on *Load unpacked*.
5. Navigate to and select the directory where you saved the ClearText extension files and click *Open*.
6. The ClearText extension should now be visible in the *Extensions* page. If it is not already activate, toggle it on.
7. The ClearText extension icon should now be visible in the extension toolbar.

### Usage

1. Navigate to a page where you would like to simplify some text.
2. Select some text. Note that ClearText is optimized to work on single sentence selections.
