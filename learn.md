These are some online courses I've enjoyed.

## From Nand to Tetris

A 2-part "learn by doing" course that guides you through the construction of a computing platform from the ground up.

### [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Covers the implementation of a simple von Neumann architecture starting with elementary logic gates and
introduces machine code and assembly programming.

### [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)

Develops the software hierarchy, from the simple construction
of an assembler, to the development of a virtual machine and a compiler, and finally the implementation of a basic
operating system.

The course ends with an open-ended project: write a program or library that can be compiled with your compiler and
run on the architecture you've built. I wrote an [implementation]((https://github.com/bencwallace/toh)) of the [Tower
of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) puzzle.

## Algorithms

An excellent introduction to algorithms and data structures.

[Parti I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) 

Discusses the fundamentals, such as stacks and queues, merge sort and quick sort, search trees, and hash tables.

[Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

Deals with graph algorithms, such as breadth- and depth-first search and Dijkstra's algorithm, as well as
string processing algorithms, such as the famous grep algorithm.

## Programming Languages

A 3-part introduction to the theory of programming languages.

### [Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

Introduces functional programming with static types through Standard ML;

### [Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b)

Introduces dynamic typing through Racket.

### [Part C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)

Introduces object-oriented programming with Ruby.

## Machine Learning

A great overview of the field: from linear and logistic regression to neural networks, support vector machines, PCA, and clustering.

## Deep Learning

A 5-course sequence on deep neural networks. The 5 courses discuss, respectively: feedforward neural networks, training techniques, structuring deep learning projects, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

## Functional Programming in Scala

The first part of a [5-course sequence](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala); an introduction to functional programming through Scala.

I hope to take the other parts sometime. These begin with an introduction to more advanced functional concepts (monads, lazy evaluation) and continue on to parallel programming and big data analysis and conclude with a capstone project.
