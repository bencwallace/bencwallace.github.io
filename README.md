## Serving

The easiest way is to use the included VSCode devcontainer or the docker-compose file
by running `docker-compose up`.

Otherwise, set up your system as follows:

1. Install Ruby
2. Install bundler: `gem install bundler`
3. Install requirements: `bundle install`

Then serve with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
